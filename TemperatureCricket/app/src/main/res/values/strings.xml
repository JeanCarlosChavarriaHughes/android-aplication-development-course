    <string name="textDesc1">Here’s a fun challenge: \n\n
        - Go outside in the evening if you know a place crickets chirp (or have a pet cricket). \n
        - Bring a stopwatch (a mobile phone has one). \n
        - Pick out the chirping sound of a single cricket. \n
        - Just count the number of chirps in 14 seconds, then add 40 to get the temperature. \n
        (Perhaps do this a few times, just to see if you’re getting the same number. Take the average.) \n
        - Check the temperature on an outdoor thermometer. \n
        - Is it close? Try it again on a cooler evening. See how the chirp frequency changes.</string>
